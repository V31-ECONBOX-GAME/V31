/**
 * Adds Maven's optional dependencies, which Gradle has no equivalent of.
 * <p>
 * Declared by the project itself:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * plugins {
 *     id("org.v31bank.optional-dependencies")
 * }
 *
 * dependencies {
 *     optional("io.lettuce:lettuce-core")
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The dependency is compiled and tested against here and left out of what a consumer
 * resolves. That is what an auto-configuration needs: it has to see the class it backs
 * off from, while a consumer that never turns the feature on must not be made to download
 * it. {@code compileOnly} would say the first half and lose the second at test time.
 * <p>
 * The configuration is left out of dependency management on purpose: it declares rather
 * than resolves, and every classpath it reaches already carries the platform, so an
 * optional dependency is named without a version like any other.
 *
