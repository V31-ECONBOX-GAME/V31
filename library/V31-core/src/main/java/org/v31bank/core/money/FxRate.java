/**
 * The price of one asset in another at a point in time — {@code 1 EUR = 1.0850 USD} — and
 * the only sanctioned way to turn {@link Money} of one asset into {@link Money} of
 * another.
 * <p>
 * The rate is directional: it says how much {@link #quote()} one unit of {@link #base()}
 * buys, and {@link #convert(Money)} refuses anything not denominated in the base. Getting
 * that backwards silently is a class of bug that only shows up in the reconciliation,
 * which is why it fails loudly instead.
 * <p>
 * {@link #asOf()} is carried because a quote is worth seconds in a market that keeps
 * moving while a request is in flight. Pricing a movement against a rate that has gone
 * stale is a real loss, so the age is checked before the rate is used rather than
 * assumed.
 *
 * @param base the asset being priced
 * @param quote the asset it is priced in
 * @param rate how much of the quote asset one unit of the base buys, always greater than
 * zero
