/**
 * An amount of one {@link Asset}, held exactly.
 * <p>
 * Every amount is kept at exactly the asset's {@link Asset#scale() scale}, so a balance
 * can only ever be a whole number of cents, of yen, or of whatever else the asset divides
 * into. Amounts that do not land on that granularity are refused rather than quietly
 * rounded: {@code Money.of(Asset.USD, new BigDecimal("1.005"))} throws, because rounding
 * money without being asked to is how a system loses a fraction of every transaction.
 * Where rounding is the intent, it is requested explicitly and the {@link RoundingMode}
 * is part of the call.
 * <p>
 * Amounts are signed. A ledger needs both directions — a debit and its matching credit, a
 * balance overdrawn against a credit line — so the rule that a customer balance cannot go
 * below zero belongs to the domain that owns that balance, not to this type.
 * <p>
 * There is no {@code double} anywhere in this class, and none should be let near one: 0.1
 * + 0.2 is not 0.3 in binary floating point, and a bank that computes balances that way
 * will not reconcile.
 * <p>
 * Instances are immutable; every operation returns a new one.
