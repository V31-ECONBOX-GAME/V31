/**
 * Something that happened, stated in the language of the domain and in the past tense: an
 * account was credited, a transfer was settled, a customer was verified.
 * <p>
 * Events are records, and they are facts. Nothing in one is a request or a decision, and
 * nothing that has already happened can be cancelled — a movement that turns out to be
 * wrong is corrected by a further event, never by rewriting or deleting the original.
 * That is what makes the sequence a usable audit trail and lets a balance be rebuilt from
 * it.
 * <p>
 * Implementations carry no messaging dependency, as the domain layer requires. What is
 * common to all of them — an identity, when it happened, what it happened to — is
 * declared here so that the outbox, the publisher, and the consumers can handle any event
 * without knowing which one it is.
