/**
 * Turns a failed call into the same {@link ApiException} the far side threw.
 * <p>
 * Without this, a service calling another has to reason about
 * {@link StatusRuntimeException} and status codes in the middle of its application layer,
 * and translate them into its own outcomes by hand at every call site. With it, a remote
 * refusal arrives as the kind of exception the rest of the platform already deals with,
 * carrying the code the far side reported.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not an interceptor</h2>
 *
 * A {@link io.grpc.ClientInterceptor} can change the status a call fails with, but not
 * the type of exception the generated stub raises from it — the stub builds a
 * {@code StatusRuntimeException} and there is no seam for anything else. So the
 * translation happens where the call is made, which also keeps it visible: a reader can
 * see that a remote failure is being converted rather than having to know that a channel
 * was configured to do it invisibly.
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * CustomerResponse response = GrpcErrors.call(() -&gt; this.customerStub.get(request));
 * </pre>
