/**
 * Output port for the chart of accounts, which this service does not own.
 * <p>
 * Declared here and implemented in the infrastructure layer, exactly as a persistence
 * port is — the application layer does not know whether the accounts come from a
 * database, a gRPC call or a cache, and swapping one for another touches only the
 * adapter.
 * <p>
 * Failures arrive as {@link ResponseStatusException}, carrying the code the ledger
 * reported. That is the point of the translation the adapter does: a remote refusal
 * reaches this layer looking like any other, and nothing here has to know what a gRPC
 * status is.
