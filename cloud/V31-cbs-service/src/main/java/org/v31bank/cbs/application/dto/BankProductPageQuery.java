/**
 * Paginated bank product query, using one-based page numbering.
 * <p>
 * The filters are limited to what the store can answer without reading everything. Valkey
 * has no query planner: a page comes from a sorted set kept up to date as products are
 * written, and the only filters offered are the ones that have such a set behind them. A
 * substring search over names would mean walking every key on the instance, which is why
 * it is not offered rather than offered slowly.
