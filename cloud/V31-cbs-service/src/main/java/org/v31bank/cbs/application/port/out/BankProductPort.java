/**
 * Output port for {@link BankProduct} persistence, implemented by the infrastructure

 * <p>
 * The code claim is a port operation rather than a check the application makes and then
 * hopes holds. A relational store gives uniqueness away for free with a constraint, and
 * both other services in this platform lean on that: they ask whether a code exists, then
 * write, and the database is what stops two callers that both got "no". Valkey has no
 * constraints, so the claim itself has to be the atomic step, and the port says so
 * instead of pretending otherwise.
