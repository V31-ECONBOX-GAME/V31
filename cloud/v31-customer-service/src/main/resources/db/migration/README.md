# Database Migrations

Schema for this service is owned by Flyway. Hibernate runs with `ddl-auto: validate`
and never creates or alters tables — it only fails startup when the entities and the
live schema disagree.

## Schema Ownership

Every service in the platform points at the same database, so each one owns a schema
named after it and nothing writes outside its own.

This is not tidiness. Flyway records what it has applied in a `flyway_schema_history`
table inside the schema it manages. Two services sharing `public` share that one table,
and each would find migrations in it that it does not have on its classpath — which
Flyway treats as a corrupted history and refuses to start on. The second service
deployed would simply not come up.

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    schemas: customer
    default-schema: customer
    create-schemas: true
  jpa:
    properties:
      hibernate:
        default_schema: customer
```

A service using jOOQ rather than JPA has no `default_schema` to set, because its
generated tables are named without one and resolve against the connection's
`search_path`. There the schema is set on the pool instead, so every connection is
already on it before jOOQ sees it:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    hikari:
      schema: compliance
```

## Versioned Migrations

Applied once, in version order.

```
V<yyyyMMddHHmmss>__<table>_<verb>[_<detail>].sql
```

```
^V\d{14}__[a-z][a-z0-9_]*_(create|drop|add|alter|rename|index|constraint|seed|backfill)(_[a-z0-9_]+)?\.sql$
```

Examples:

```
V20260729010000__customer_create.sql
V20260803142530__customer_add_kyc_status.sql
V20260810093015__customer_alter_email_length.sql
V20260825090000__customer_index_status.sql
```

The version is a zero-padded timestamp rather than a sequence number, so migrations
authored on parallel branches never collide on merge. The table name always occupies
the same position, which keeps `ls **/*__customer_*` a reliable way to read the history
of a single table.

## Repeatable Migrations

Re-applied whenever their checksum changes, always after every pending versioned
migration. Use them for objects that describe a desired end state rather than a
historical change — the file holds the current definition, and its diff is the change
history.

```
R__<object>_<kind>.sql
```

```
^R__[a-z][a-z0-9_]*_(view|function|procedure|trigger)\.sql$
```

Examples:

```
R__customer_summary_view.sql
R__customer_risk_score_function.sql
```

Write them idempotently — `create or replace view` rather than `create view` — since
they run again on every checksum change.

## Verbs

A closed vocabulary — pick one, do not invent new ones.

| Verb         | Use for                                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `create`     | Creating a table                                             |
| `drop`       | Dropping a table, or dropping a column                       |
| `add`        | Adding a column                                              |
| `alter`      | Changing a column type, length, nullability, or default      |
| `rename`     | Renaming a table or a column                                 |
| `index`      | Creating or dropping an index                                |
| `constraint` | Unique, foreign key, or check constraints                    |
| `seed`       | Reference or lookup data shipped with the schema             |
| `backfill`   | Populating existing rows, typically alongside a new column   |

## Layout

Migrations are grouped into one directory per year. Flyway scans
`classpath:db/migration` recursively, so the grouping is purely for browsing and does
not affect ordering — execution order is global and determined by the version alone.

```
db/migration/
  2026/
    V20260729010000__customer_create.sql
  2027/
```

## Rules

1. **Never modify a migration that has been applied.** Flyway stores a checksum in
   `flyway_schema_history`; editing an applied file fails the next startup with a
   checksum mismatch. Correct a mistake by adding a new migration.
2. **One logical change per file.** Keeps failures easy to locate and review diffs
   readable.
3. **Ship data with the schema change that needs it.** A new `not null` column means
   add the column, backfill existing rows, then apply the constraint — all in the same
   file, so it either fully succeeds or fully rolls back.
4. **Write PostgreSQL.** These scripts are not portable and are not meant to be;
   integration tests run against a real PostgreSQL instance, never an in-memory
   substitute.
5. **Use `R__` for repeatable objects.** Views, functions, and procedures describe a
   desired end state rather than a historical change, and are re-applied whenever their
   checksum changes.
